A quick and dirty middleman for getting updates from Pivotal Tracker into HipChat, but with all the noise of edits, reordering, and comments filtered out. Just new tickets and progress updates.

Set up to run direct on heroku, just clone and set up a (bamboo) Heroku app, and set up the following environment keys via heroku config:add:

    HIPCHAT_TOKEN - api token from hipchat, notification-only expected
    HIPCHAT_ROOM - name of the room to dump updates into

If you want to run not on Heroku, you can provide those two variables in a file called `env` in the project root, the format is `KEY=value`, one per line, no spaces or padding.
